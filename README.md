Classifying handwritten digits is the basic problem of the machine learning and can be solved in many ways here we will implement them by using TensorFlow
Using a Linear Classifier Algorithm with tf.contrib.learn 
linear classifier achieves the classification of handwritten digits by making a choice based on the value of a linear combination of the features also known as feature values and is typically presented to the machine in a vector called a feature vector.
